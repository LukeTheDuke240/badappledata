# Bad Apple in Krunkscript

Step 1: Load the map here: https://krunker.io/?host=Bad_Apple This will load a cookie with the correct ID.

Step 2: Open devtools, navigate to application, then localstorage, then krunker.io. Search for "69" and observe the key's name. In my case it was "krkcst_140784_test", so we need to create a key called "krkcst_140784_rawdata". Make sure it's identical apart from rawdata.

Step 3: Download and open the provided display.txt file and copy the contents into the newly created rawdata key.

Step 4: Reload the map, and enjoy.
